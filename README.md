# 💳 Cash Card Spring – Spring Boot Enterprise Foundations
This project is an introduction to Spring and Spring Boot, focused on understanding how enterprise-grade backend systems are structured, tested, and deployed.

The goal of this repository is not just to build a simple application, but to gain hands-on experience with patterns and practices used in real-world production systems — knowledge that will later be applied to larger projects such as scalable backend architectures.
